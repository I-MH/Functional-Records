# Functional-Records
These are R codes to estimate record curves on a functional time series data. The methodology is described in the paper 
'Functional Time Series Analysis Based on Records' authored by Israel Martínez-Hernández and Marc G. Genton (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.06083.pdf).

This is still under construction. I will add more function to have all R codes of the methods described in the main paper. 
If there is a specific code you would like to have, please contact me.
